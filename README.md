# QMXStdLib

## Synopsis

> QuantuMatriX Software Standard Library - V1.0.0
> Copyright (C) 2011-2016 QuantuMatriX Software, LLP.
>
> This library is meant to offer an array of general-purpose data structures and algorithms for a multitude of uses.  Each structure must be examined for its specific usefulness to be determined.  Please see the API documentation for more details, or visit the QMX Software website at 'software.qmxtech.com'.

## Building

> The source release for QMXStdLib may be downloaded from: 'https://git.qmxtech.com/open-source/qmxstdlib'.
>
> To build using CMake, use the following steps:
>
> * Navigate to the project's root directory, and create a new directory called 'build'.
> * Enter the 'build' directory and run the following command (replacing '[GENERATOR]' with the name of the desired CMake generator; note that only Clang and GCC-based compilers are currently supported):
>
>> cmake -G "[GENERATOR]" ..
>
> * After the project files are fully generated, build in the usual manner.

## Installing and Uninstalling

> For all platforms, API Doxygen documentation is automatically generated by the installation process.  Once the project is built, the 'install.sh' script can be used to install/uninstall based on the provided arguments.  Installation is as follows:
>> install.sh PLATFORM MODE=0 TARGET ABI_VERSION BUILD_VERSION HEADERS_PATH LIBS_PATH DOCS_PATH
>
> Where 'PLATFORM' is one of 'lin' (GNU Linux), 'mac' (Apple Mac OS X), or 'win' (Microsoft Windows); 'TARGET' is the base binary name; 'ABI_VERSION' is the current major application binary interface version; 'BUILD_VERSION' is the current full version; 'HEADERS_PATH' is the destination path for the header files; 'LIBS_PATH' is the destination path for the library files; and 'DOCS_PATH' is the destination path for the documentation.  The following is a full example of the above:
>
>> install.sh lin 0 foo 1 1.0.0 /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/share/doc
>
> Uninstallation is as follows:
>
>> install.sh PLATFORM MODE=1 TARGET BUILD_VERSION HEADERS_PATH LIBS_PATH DOCS_PATH
>
> Where 'PLATFORM' is one of 'lin' (GNU Linux), 'mac' (Apple Mac OS X), or 'win' (Microsoft Windows); 'TARGET' is the base name of the installed binary; 'BUILD_VERSION' is the full version of the installed project; 'HEADERS_PATH' is the path to the installed header files; 'LIBS_PATH' is the path to the installed library files; and 'DOCS_PATH' is the path to the installed documentation.  The following is a full example of the above:
>
>> install.sh lin 1 foo 1.0.0 /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/share/doc
>
> Note: For some platforms, administrative rights may be needed to run the script.
