# QMXStdLib

## Synopsis

> QuantuMatriX Software Standard Library - V2.1.1
> Copyright (C) 2011-2019 QuantuMatriX Software, a QuantuMatriX Technologies Cooperative Partnership
>
> This library is meant to offer an array of general-purpose data structures and algorithms for a multitude of uses.  Each structure must be examined for its specific usefulness to be determined.  Please see the API documentation for more details, or visit the QMXStdLib website at 'https://git.qmx-software.com/open-source/qmxstdlib/'.

## Building

> To build using CMake, use the following steps:
>
> * Navigate to the project's root directory, and create a new directory called 'build'.
> * Enter the 'build' directory and run the following command (replacing '[GENERATOR]' with the name of the desired CMake generator; note that only Clang and GCC-based compilers are currently supported):
>
>> cmake -G "[GENERATOR]" ..
>
> * After the project files are fully generated, build in the usual manner.  The following targets are supported:
>
>> * all (default; includes 'debug' and 'release')
>> * debug
>> * relwithdebinfo
>> * release
>> * minsizerel
>> * doc (builds Doxygen documentation)
>> * tests (includes 'tests_debug' and 'tests_release' )
>> * tests_debug
>> * tests_relwithdebinfo
>> * tests_release
>> * tests_minsizerel
>> * install (only targets actually built will be installed; unit tests are never installed)
>> * uninstall

## Installing and Uninstalling

> To install on any platform, use the 'install' target of the generated project files.  To uninstall on any platform, use the 'uninstall' target of the generated project files.  Note that on a GNU Linux platform, you will need to run 'ldconfig' after the installation process; otherwise, the system will not be able to locate the new libraries.

## CMake Package

> This project provides a CMake package which can be used with the 'find_package' command.  Once found, the following variables are set:
>
>> * QMXStdLib_VERSION (the current library version)
>> * QMXStdLib_LIB_DEBUG (the debug build of the library)
>> * QMXStdLib_LIB_RELEASE (the release build of the library)
>> * QMXStdLib_INCLUDE_PATH (the library headers path)
>> * QMXStdLib_LIB_PATH (the library path)
